# Minecraft Computer
A simple 16-bit processor (not x86 compatible). You can select the integer bit size as well as the RAM capacity. The system can use replaceable ROMs as a way to exceed the program counter bit limit.

### Integrated Development Environment
To simplify the process of developing new algorithms [IDE](https://mccomputer.netlify.app/) was created. It allows you to debug your algorithm with breakpoints and do a step by step interpretation. You can see in real time all of the stored values in registers and RAM. You can also use the integrated console to insert code directly to the processor.
